                        My hair has loved this mask since I started using it over a year ago. I began using for my son’s hair and it has flourished beyond belief. I shaved his head a year agobecause I could not do his hair with all the matting that was occurring because he refused
                        to allow me to detangle it. Because of this mask, his hair has GROWN so so much and it is soft and thick and VERY manageable. I blew it out just so I could trim it a little and I could not believe his hair was down his back. Belle
                        Bar is the TRUTH!!!

                        I wish I could share more than one photo! I took several photos and made a short video to post of what the chebe powder has done for my hair!! I'm low porosity so I only use it twice a month. And I can always tell when I use it! Makes my hair super soft
                        and I can also finger detangle!!! Love it I've order two so far!! </p>

                        I have curls!! My hair feels great and the curls are popping all over the place. And, it is dense and stronger than it has been in years. I don't care about the shrinkage, and it is major - lol, because the curls looks healthy and live. Thank you, Belle
                        Bar, also for giving me understanding of my hair and how to treat it. </p>
